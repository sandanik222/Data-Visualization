# Introduction


## Research Questions

- Does the location of the property affect the Average land value in NYC?
- Which borough has the average highest land value?

## Data

- The Primary Land Use Tax Lot Output (PLUTO) is the data source used for this project.

- PLUTO is being provided by the Department of City Planning (DCP) on DCPâ€™s website for informational purposes only.

- The original data set contains data of around 859877 properties in New York City.

- PLUTO includes 92 variables that provide detailed information on land use, building characteristics, and tax assessment values for each property in the city.


## Data Cleaning

- Original Data set had many missing values.
- Disproportionate stratified sampling was used to select a subset of data from the original PLUTO data set.
- The subset included 200 random properties from each borough, resulting in a new data set.
- Stratified sampling ensures that each borough is represented in the sample.

## Variables

- **Borough:** The borough in which the property is located.
- **Block:** The tax block in which the property is located. It contains a one to five-digit tax block number. Each tax block is unique within a borough.
- **lot:** The number of the tax lot. It contains a one to four-digit tax lot number. Each tax lot
  is unique within a tax block.
- **schooldist:** The school district in which the property lot is located.
- **policeprct:** The police precinct in which the property is located.
- **healthcenterdistrict:**	The health center district in which the property is located.
- **sanitdistrict:** The sanitation district that services the property.
- **ave_land:** Average price of the land (Dollars per Square Foot)

## Conclusions

- As we observed, the value (price) of land in New York is influenced significantly by it's location with Manhattan Borough having averagely the most priced land.

- In Manhattan, school district 2, is generally associated with high land value as compared to the others.

- Similarly, 14th to 18th police precincts;  health centered districts 13 and 15, sanitation district 5 are associated with high values of lands in Manhattan.
